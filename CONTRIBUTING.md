We have adopted the following style guidelines:
 - Use `kebab-case` file names, as they are used when forming the documentation URLs
   * Lower case with a `-` to separate words
 - Place no more than one sentence per source line whenever allowed by markdown syntax
   * Table rows have to be crammed into a single line
   * One sentence can be spread over multiple source lines if it is long
