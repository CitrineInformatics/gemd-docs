# Taurus data model documentation

Deployed to [https://citrineinformatics.github.io/taurus-documentation/](https://citrineinformatics.github.io/taurus-documentation/).
Built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#mkdocs)

You'll need a working python environment, with pip.
This comes by default if you install python with homebrew. 

```
pip install mkdocs
```

To build the static site in `./site`:
```
mkdocs build
```

To serve the site, with live reloading:
```
mkdocs serve
```
This will be served at localhost:8000 by default
