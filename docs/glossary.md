# Glossary

### Attribute
A characteristic of a material, process, or measurement. Attributes can be a GEMD property, condition, or parameter.

### Attribute Template
Attribute templates define a domain concept (e.g. density, yield strength), and include bounds to define acceptable values for a given attribute.

### Bounds
Bounds are used in object and attribute templates. Object templates define the least constrained bounds, and attribute templates can constrain bounds to a tighter range or set.  Bounds may be real or categorical.

### Categorical Bounds
Bounds that are defined by a list of categories.

### Condition Attribute
Environmental variables (typically measured) that may affect a process or measurement, such as temperature or pressure.

### Data Object
GEMD materials, processes, measurements, and ingredients. Data objects along with attributes are linked to form a complete description of a material and how it was created.

### GEMD
Graphical Expression of Materials Data, an open source format for storing materials data.

### Ingredient Object
A  data object that annotates a material with information related to its usage in a process. Ingredient objects are used define how much of a material is used in a new process. Note that 'ingredient' and 'material' object definitions are not interchangeable.

### Material Object
GEMD data object that describes a physical substance that is generated by a linked process object and is characterized by its properties. GEMD does not allow material objects to exist in isolation, since fully describing a material data point requires, at minimum, identifing how the material was procured.  

### Material Spec
A specification of a material, such as a purchased ingredient or reference material, typically from a data sheet.

### Measurement Run
A recorded measurement for a specific material run object. 

### Measurement Object
A data object used to describe an operation that measures or characterizes properties of a material.

### Nominal Real Value
A value type in which the value is recorded as a specific number, with no information about the uncertainty of that number.

### Object Template
Object Templates define a domain concept for a process, material or measurement. Importantly, object templates compose bounds from attribute templates into constraints that define valid ranges.

### Parameter Attribute
Describes the settings of a tool in a process or measurement object. Parameters are non-environmental variables (typically specified and controlled) that may affect a process or measurement, such as oven dial temperature position for a kiln firing, or magnification for a measurement taken with a SEM.

### PIF
Portable Information Format, a precursor to GEMD that is no longer in use

### Process Object
GEMD data object that describes an operation to generate an output material from inputs

### Process Run
A recorded run of a process, which may include parameters that are controlled and/or measured.

### Process Template
Process templates are used to define constraints for the names and labels of ingredients. They may link conditions and parameters. (FIXME) 

### Property Attribute
Describes a measured or calculated property of a material object. A property is a characteristic of a material that can be measured, such as chemical composition, density, or yield strength.

###  PropertyAndConditions
Known or unmeasured properties of a Material Spec, with specified conditions. (FIXME this def is not good, this is really squishy)

### Real Bounds
Bounds defined by a range of finite real values and a unit.

### State
Template, spec and run. Data objects are created in a state, representing generalization (template), intent (spec), and actual result (run)

### Tag
Tags are used to categorize Object Templates.

### Uniform Real Value
A value type in which the value is recorded as a range, with a lower bound and an upper bound, to represent the uncertainty of the measurement.
